### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github.

â˜• Iâ€™m currently working on building a multimedia platform at Morning Brew targeted at business professionals.


ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the behind the scenes tech at the Brew! Some things we've built:

* A custom referral program to drive growth.
* An editorial CMS to make building high engagement newsletters a breeze.
* A custom sales tool for tracking and managing upcoming native ad placements. (Both Web, Email, and Podcasts)
* More coming soon! ...
